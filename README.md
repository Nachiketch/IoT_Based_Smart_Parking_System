# IoT_Based_Smart_Parking_System
Our team successfully designed and implemented an IoT-based Smart Parking System to address the persistent parking issues in metropolitan cities. With the aim of providing a convenient and efficient parking solution, we utilized Arduino, various sensors, and other components to develop a functional prototype.

Using C++ programming, we integrated the Arduino microcontroller with sensors such as infrared sensors to detect the availability of parking spaces. These sensors would transmit real-time data to our IoT platform, and display the number of parking slots available on screen display.
